                    <p>Qui-Gon Jinn, a Force-sensitive human male, was a venerable if maverick Jedi
                        Master
                        who lived during the last years of the Republic Era. He was a wise and
                        well-respected member of the Jedi Order, and was offered a seat on the Jedi
                        Council,
                        but chose to reject and follow his own path. Adhering to a philosophy centered
                        around the Living Force, Jinn strove to follow the will of the Force even when
                        his
                        actions conflicted with the wishes of the High Council. After encountering
                        Anakin
                        Skywalker, Jinn brought him to the Jedi Temple on Coruscant, convinced he had
                        found
                        the Chosen One. His dying wish was for Skywalker to become a Jedi and ultimately
                        restore balance to the Force.</p>
